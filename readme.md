# Sustainable Energy Report Generator

This project is dedicated to generating Microsoft Word reports about sustainable energy
projects, such as photovoltaic systems. The reports are automatically generated using
Python, docxtpl, and the OpenWeather API.

## Features

- **Automated Report Generation**: This project uses Python and docxtpl to generate
  detailed reports in Microsoft Word format.
- **Sustainable Energy Focus**: The reports focus on sustainable energy projects, with a
  particular emphasis on photovoltaic systems.
- **Weather Data Integration**: The OpenWeather API is used to fetch real-time weather
  data, which can impact the performance of photovoltaic systems.
